# Practical Automation: Simple everyday tools/helpers

Within this repository, you'll find:

## Work tools

* **[JIRA QuickJump](https://github.com/neilstudd/practical-automation/tree/master/jira-quickjump)** - A Windows script which can be launched with a keyboard shortcut to allow for custom querying of one (or more) JIRA repositories.
* **[Slack Wherebot](https://github.com/neilstudd/practical-automation/tree/master/slack-wherebot)** - A simple Slack bot, hosted on Heroku, which can be programmed to give custom responses (in my example, telling people where they can find meeting rooms).

## Non-work projects

* **[Cineworld cinema listings watcher](https://github.com/neilstudd/practical-automation/tree/master/cineworld-listings)** - Get an email when new showtimes are announced for your local cinema.
* **[Cineworld Unlimited Preview announcement listener](https://github.com/neilstudd/practical-automation/tree/master/cineworld-unlimited)** - Get an email when a new Unlimited Preview screening goes on sale.
* **[Dictionary Searches](https://github.com/neilstudd/practical-automation/tree/master/dictionary-searches)** - Iterate through a dictionary and return all words that match a particular pattern (e.g. all words that can be made just using letters on the top row of the keyboard).
